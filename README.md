In this project I created a heat-map using a freeCodeCamp API and transferred the data and converted it
to JSON. With that parsed data I used the JavaScript data library extension D3 to match the accumulated 
variant temperature data to the months of the year from previous years. I created axes using the 'g' element
and created equal dimension rectangles to represent the temperature data using the 'selectAll('rect').append('rect')'
method from D3.
